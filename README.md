# Intro-to-Network-Programming

## HW1: Simple IRC Server
- We implement the server, and test the server by the weechat client

## HW2: DNS server
- We implement the dns server with provided config file and zone file, and test the server by dig package

## Lab8: Reliable UDP Challenge
- We implement both client and server
- Sender(client) send 1000 files using UDP with high speed transmission
- We need to ensure 100% corerctness at the receiver(server) under highly congested network
